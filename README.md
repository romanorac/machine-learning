# Machine learning algorithms #
We implemented following algorithms in development of discomll library:
- linear regression,
- locally weighted linear regression,
- decision tree,
- random forest, 
- weighted forest. 

We implemented tests that compare implemented ensemble algorithms with scikit's ensemble algorithms on multiple datasets.
